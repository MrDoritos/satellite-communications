If you used github web extract the zip.
Transverse into project folder
If on linux, it probably won't compile, but you can try compile.sh anyway
If on windows, just run compile.bat. You may not be able to compile the GUI, unless you have the windows SDK. It is only necessary to compile host.cpp right now.
